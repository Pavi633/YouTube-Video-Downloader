# YouTube-Video-Downloader
### Abstract

This project is a YouTube Video Downloader application built with Python and Tkinter for a straightforward graphical interface. It allows users to download YouTube videos or extract audio-only content, providing a flexible tool for various media download needs. 

Key functionalities include:
1. Resolution Selection: Users can choose from a list of available resolutions, with a fallback to the highest available if the selected one is unavailable.
2. Audio-Only Option: Users can opt to download just the audio track, which is saved in ".mp3 " format.
3. Progress Tracking: A progress bar offers real-time feedback during downloads, enhancing user engagement.
4. Responsive Design: Multi-threading is implemented to run downloads in the background, ensuring a smooth user experience without freezing the interface.

This downloader is accessible to users of all experience levels and provides instant visual feedback through notifications, making it ideal for personal or educational use. It integrates Pytube for YouTube stream handling and leverages threading to improve application responsiveness, delivering a practical and user-friendly downloading solution.
